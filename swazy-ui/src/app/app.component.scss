// Optional: Add some global margin or padding if needed, though DaisyUI's container class usually handles this.
// For example, if you want to ensure the app content doesn't touch the very top of the viewport.
// body {
//   padding-top: 1rem;
// }

// Specific adjustments if any DaisyUI components need slight tweaks for this layout.
// For instance, ensuring forms have adequate spacing or specific alignment not covered by default classes.
// .form-control {
//   margin-bottom: 1rem; // Example: Ensure consistent bottom margin for form controls
// }

// For now, let's just ensure the file exists and is ready for any specific styles if they become necessary during testing.
// No specific styles will be added unless an issue is identified with the current DaisyUI setup.
// Just make sure the file is present. If it doesn't exist, create an empty one.
// If it exists, leave its content as is, unless specific styling is requested by the user or needed to fix a UI issue.

// For the purpose of this task, we will add a small style to ensure the component has some specific style.
// This is mostly to demonstrate the step, as DaisyUI should cover most needs.
:host {
  display: block; // Ensures the app component behaves like a block-level element
  padding: 1rem; // Adds some padding around the entire app content
}

// Ensure table IDs are not too wide
table td:first-child {
  max-width: 150px;
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
  white-space: nowrap;
}
